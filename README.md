Answer to Code Kata challenge - Data Munging

The script below is my answer to the Data Munging (Part Three) challenge from Code Kata.
The only resources that I used were Rubular (for the RegEx) and the Ruby docs (no Google searches, no Stack Overflow).

The goal was to first write separate scripts to read two different data files and then refactor those scripts to
produce one script that can evaluate BOTH data files. More specifically, the data tables were parsed to determine
which row had smallest spread (i.e. difference) between selected columns. One data set shows the soccer goal differential
for various teams and the other set shows the minimum and maximum temperatures for various days of a month.
